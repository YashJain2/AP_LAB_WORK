      <h2>Linear harmonic oscillator</h2>  <article>
      In a classical mechanics, a linear harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force F proportional to the displacement x.      , where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple linear harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmpnic motion. Sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a> constant frequency (which does not depend on the amplitude). If a frictional force (damping) proportional to the velocity is also present the harmonic oscillator is decribed as a damped oscillator.</article>
      </br> Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can ;</br>
(1) Oscillate with a frequency lower than in the undamped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time (underdamped oscillator).</br>
(2) Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations (overdamped oscillator).</br>
The bounded or the boundary solution between an underdamped oscillator and an overdamped oscillator occurs at a particular value of the friction coefficient and is called the critically damped. If an external time-dependent force is present, the linear harmonic oscillator is described as a driven oscillator. Mechanical examples include pendulums (with small angles of displacement), masses connected to springs and acoustical systems. Other analogous system include electrical harmonic oscillators such as RLC circuits. The harmonic oscillator model is very important in Physics , because any mass subject to a force in stable equilibrium acts as a linear harmonic oscillator for small variations. Harmonic oscillation occur widely in nature and are exploited in many manmade devices, such as clocks and radio circuits. They are the source of virtually all sinusoidal vibrations and waves.

  <h2>Simple linear harmonic oscillator</h2>
  <article>A simple linear harmonic oscillator is an oscillator that is neither driven nor damped. It consists of a mass m, which experiences a single force F, which pulls the mass in the direction of the point x=0 and depends only on the position x of the mass and a constant k. Balance of forces (Newton’s second law) for the system is
F=ma=–kx</article>
Solving this differential equation, we can find that the motion is described by the function x(t)=Acos(wt+f), where w= .The motion is periodic, repeating itself in a sinusoidal fashion with constant amplitude A. In addition to its amplitude, the motion of a simple linear harmonic oscillator is characterized by its period T=2p/w, the time for a single oscillation or its frequency f=1/T, the number of cycle per unit time. The position at a given time t also depends on the phase f, which determines the starting point on the sine wave. The period and frequency are determined by the size of the mass m and the constant i.e. force constant k, while the amplitude and phase are determined by the starting position and velocity.
The velocity and acceleration of a simple linear harmonic oscillator oscillate with the same frequency as the position, but with shifted phases. The velocity is maximal for zero displacement, while the acceleration in the direction opposite to the displacement. The potential energy stored in a simple linear harmonic oscillator at position x is U=

  <h2>Simple Harmonic Motion </h2>
    <article>Introduction :- It is to be familiar with many examples of repeated motion in our daily life. If an object returns to its original position a number of time, we call its motion repetitive. Typically in examples of repetitive motion of the human body are heartbeat and breathing. Many objects move in a repetitive way, a swing, a rocking chair and a clock pendulum, for example.</article> Probably the first understanding the ancients had of repetitive motion grew out of their observations of the motion of the sun and the phases of the moon. Strings undergoing repetitive motion are the physical basis of all stringed musical instruments.
  Kinematics of Simple Harmonic Motion :- One common characteristics of the motions of the heartbeat, clock pendulum, voilin string, and the rotating phonograph turntable is that each motion has a well-defined time interval for each complete cycle of the motion. Any motion that repeat itself with equal time intervals is called periodic motion. Its period is the time required for one cycle of the motion.
